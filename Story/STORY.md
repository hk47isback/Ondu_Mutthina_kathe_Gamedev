# Story (Core)

## Premise
Aithu, a fisherman, discovers a single perfect pearl while out at sea. The pearl becomes a catalyst for a dark moral tale: it awakens hope and desperate plans in the village, strains relationships, and escalates toward a chilling betrayal and violent ambush.

## Themes
- Ownership vs. duty
- Greed and its human cost
- Community pressure and personal stakes

## Main Characters (Story Roles)
- **Aithu**: Protagonist; finds the pearl and must decide what to do with it.
- **Friend**: A well-meaning villager who becomes desperate and attempts to take the pearl “for the village.”
- **Merchant**: A seemingly legitimate buyer whose interest turns coercive.
- **Merchant’s Men**: Enforcers used to seize the pearl.
- **Aithu’s family**: Wife and child; the emotional stakes.

## Narrative Beats (Prototype / Vertical Slice)
1. **Discovery**: Aithu finds the pearl (set-piece discovery).
2. **Revelation / Reaction**: Keeping it private vs. showing others changes social pressure.
3. **Friend Conflict**: The friend’s desperation triggers a betrayal attempt.
4. **Merchant Offer**: Negotiation introduces suspicion and risk.
5. **Tragic Climax**: The merchant returns with hired men; events escalate into a violent ambush.

## Choice Beats (High-Level)
- **Show & Claim**: Keep the pearl private vs. show it publicly vs. inform a mentor/wise figure.
- **Response to Friend**: Forgive vs. confront vs. attempt compromise.
- **Merchant Negotiation**: Accept vs. decline.

## Ending Tone
The prototype is driven toward a tragic climax to emphasize emotional impact, even if intermediate states vary during playtesting.
