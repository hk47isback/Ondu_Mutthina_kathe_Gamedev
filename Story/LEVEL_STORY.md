# Level Story (Vertical Slice)

This is the story flow **as it maps to locations/scenes** in the prototype.

## 1) Sea / Underwater Cavern — “Discovery”
- Aithu goes out to fish.
- He discovers the pearl in an underwater area.
- The moment is quiet, tense, and intimate: the pearl feels rare and consequential.

## 2) Village / Market / Shop — “Pressure Begins”
- News of the pearl (or Aithu’s changed behavior) creates social attention.
- The merchant appears friendly and offers a deal.
- The village context makes it clear the pearl could change lives.

## 3) Village Friend Encounter — “Desperation”
- A friend approaches with an argument: the pearl should help the village.
- This escalates into a betrayal attempt (theft or confrontation depending on choices).
- The player’s response shapes the relationship and sets flags for later scenes.

## 4) Aithu’s Home — “Stakes”
- A scene with Aithu’s family reinforces what can be lost.
- The pearl is no longer just an item: it’s a threat and a temptation.

## 5) Alley / Ambush Location — “Tragic Climax”

- The confrontation escalates into a violent ambush that targets Aithu and his family.
- The prototype ends on this dark outcome as the core emotional beat.
