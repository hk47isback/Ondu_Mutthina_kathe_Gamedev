# Legal & Rights Checklist

This document provides a conservative checklist and guidance for adapting or drawing inspiration from an older film such as "Ondu Muttina Kathe".

## Important note
This document is NOT legal advice. For anything beyond initial research, consult a licensed IP attorney.

## Checklist
1. Confirm copyright ownership
   - Find the registered copyright owner for the film (production company, distributor, or heirs).
   - Check if the copyright has been renewed or transferred.

2. Confirm status in India
   - Cinematograph films in India are protected for 60 years from publication (verify current law or amendments).
   - Confirm whether the film is still in copyright (1987 release — likely still under copyright in 2025 and beyond).

3. Confirm status in your target markets
   - If your game markets in the US/EU, confirm local law. In the US, copyright term is generally life+70 or 95/120 for works made for hire depending on creation date.

4. Moral Rights & Likeness
   - Likeness rights and moral rights persist even after death in some jurisdictions. Avoid using a real performer’s exact likeness without permission.

5. Elements requiring permission
   - Movie script and dialogue
   - Character names and likenesses
   - Original soundtrack (music & score)
   - Clips or still images from the film
   - Title or brand name (e.g., using the same film title in marketing) — these may be trademarks

6. Steps to license (if needed)
   - Contact producer or production company (e.g., Padmashree Enterprises or distribution rights holder)
   - Explain intended use, platforms to publish, and proposed revenue model
   - Negotiate a contract that includes rights, payment, and duration

7. Alternatives (if licensing is blocked)
   - Create an original story inspired by the film's themes without using the film’s protected elements
   - Use original music and create new characters and names
   - Seek public domain source material (e.g., the underlying novel "The Pearl" by John Steinbeck) — check its copyright status (Steinbeck’s work is likely in public domain in some countries but check local laws)

8. Documentation & Release
   - Keep records of any license, permissions, asset attributions, and waivers
   - In promotional materials, avoid referencing the movie title or claiming affiliation unless the license allows it

## Practical Tips
- Rename characters and avoid reusing dialogue or uniquely identifying scenes replicate directly from the film.
- Use original music and sound design or properly licensed stock music.
- If using a cultural element (Kannada language, local dialect), consult local cultural experts to ensure sensitivity.

## Next Legal Steps for this Project
1. Use this checklist to research and record owners and rights.
2. If ownership is unclear, reach out to the production company or local film board.
3. Budget for licensing if you need to replicate large parts of the original film.
4. Otherwise, adapt a similar concept as a 'spirit of' adaptation and develop an original story and characters.
