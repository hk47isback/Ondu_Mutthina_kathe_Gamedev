# Sprints & Production Schedule

This schedule assumes a single developer with occasional freelance support. It focuses on delivering a polished demo/vertical slice in ~12 weeks and a full MVP in 6–9 months.

## Sprint Length
- 1-week sprints for planning tasks (fast feedback loop)
- 2-week sprints for larger implementation tasks

## High-level Timeline (12 weeks for vertical slice)
- Weeks 1–2: Setup + Basic Player & Controls (Tech setup) — deliverable: initial playable scene
- Weeks 3–4: Inventory + Pearl Item + Pickup logic
- Weeks 5–6: NPC Dialogue + Merchant trade scenario
- Weeks 7–8: Underwater scene + oxygen/pressure mechanic or tension event
- Weeks 9–10: Branching endings + Save system
- Weeks 11–12: Polish, QA, packaging for demo, and initial marketing assets (trailer & screenshots)

## Backlog Template (Example tasks for sprints)
- Task type tags: [Design] [Tech] [Art] [Audio] [QA] [Marketing]

Sample tasks for week 1
- [Tech] Create Godot project and apply project settings
- [Design] Finalize GDD for vertical slice
- [Art] Create placeholder terrain & beach environment
- [Tech] Implement player movement and water interaction volume

## Sprint Reviews & Playtests
- At the end of each sprint, conduct a 1-hour play session with a dev or friend and collect feedback
- Track bugs via a simple Kanban board (Trello/Asana/Notion) or a spreadsheet with severity and priority tags

## Release & Marketing Milestones
- Vertical-slice demo: weeks 11–12
- Demo release: itch.io and small song/description
- Build a short reveal trailer (30–60 seconds) by week 8–10

## Risk Management
- Use placeholders to avoid delays from custom art
- If an asset is blocking, schedule an outsourced microtask
- Keep scope small to avoid burnout and delays

## Acceptance Criteria for MVP
- All core systems implemented and stable
- 3 playable scenes with basic branching
- One polished set-piece (underwater)
- UI and audio implemented to an acceptable level for public demo
- No critical blocking bugs in final build
